We found a set of Facebook social network graph from:
http://odysseas.calit2.uci.edu/doku.php/public:online_social_networks#facebook_social_graph

And we tranlate the raw data type into ADM compatible format using several scripts:
- raw2adm.py: tranlate raw data type into ADM file.
- namegen.py: randomly generate full names from two name datasets.
- readline.sh: extract first n lines of data from a large set of graph data.

We also collect a lite version of name sets for random name generation:
- first-names.txt
- surnames.txt
