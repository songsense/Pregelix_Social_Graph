Pregelix_Social_Graph
=====================
In our project we take Twitter networking web as a big graph, treating users as vertices and their relations as edges, and retrieve meaningful information from the graph model using Pregelix. 

Tasks include:
complete the following three tasks for graph analysis. 
- could be APIs for the next task.
incorporate the graph model with the data mining analysis in order to retrieve some “intriguing” facts from the big social graph.
develope a web UI that can demonstrate the results we discovered in a simple, elegant and illustrative way.
