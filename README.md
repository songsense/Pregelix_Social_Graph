Pregelix_Social_Graph
=====================
In our project we take Twitter networking web as a big graph, treating users as vertices and their relations as edges, and retrieve meaningful information from the graph model using Pregelix. 

Tasks include:
1. complete the following three tasks for graph analysis. 
2. incorporate the graph model with the data mining analysis in order to retrieve some “intriguing” facts from the big social graph.
3. develope a web UI that can demonstrate the results we discovered in a simple, elegant and illustrative way.
